## ðŸ”¹ What is Noise Margin? (Core Idea)

Every digital gate (including a CMOS inverter) must tolerate certain variations in voltage due to **glitches, crosstalk, and supply noise**. The **noise margin** quantifies how much noise a gate can withstand without logic failure.

To understand this, you imagine the **VTC (Voltage Transfer Curve)** of the inverter:

- X-axis: Vin
- Y-axis: Vout
- As Vin goes from 0 â†’ VDD, Vout drops from VDD â†’ 0.

In an **ideal case**, the transition is vertical at VDD/2 (infinite slope), but practically:

- Due to series resistances & device capacitances,
- The curve slopes gradually in the switching region.

So we extract practical voltage thresholds:

- **VOH** â†’ Maximum output high (â‰ˆ near VDD)
- **VOL** â†’ Minimum output low (â‰ˆ near 0V)
- **VIL** â†’ Max input voltage still treated as logic 0
- **VIH** â†’ Min input voltage treated as logic 1

## ðŸ”¹ Logical Interpretation

- Input between **0 â†’ VIL** â†’ Output stays high (VOH)
- Input between **VIH â†’ VDD** â†’ Output goes low (VOL)
- Any region **between VIL and VIH** â†’ Undefined behavior

This undefined window is where logic can become unstable if noise/glitch lands there.

## ðŸ”¹ Noise Margin Equations

From the voltage map:

```
0        VOL    VIL    VIH    VOH      VDD
|---------|------|------|------|---------|
  Logic 0  |undef|      undef   | Logic 1

```

We define:

âœ… **Noise Margin Low (NML)**

NML=VILâˆ’VOL\text{NML} = V_{IL} - V_{OL}

NML=VILâˆ’VOL

âœ… **Noise Margin High (NMH)**

NMH=VOHâˆ’VIH\text{NMH} = V_{OH} - V_{IH}

NMH=VOHâˆ’VIH

These indicate how much noise can be tolerated at logic-0 and logic-1 levels respectively.

Any glitch/bump:

- If it stays inside **NML / NMH region** â†’ SAFE
- If it enters **undefined region** â†’ Risky
- If it crosses into opposite logic window â†’ Logic failure

## ðŸ”¹ PMOS Width Impact on Noise Margin

As PMOS size increases (keeping NMOS same):

| PMOS Size vs NMOS | Effect on NMH | Effect on NML |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Equal sizing | Balanced | Balanced |
| 2Ã— PMOS | NMH â†‘ | NML ~ same |
| 3Ã— PMOS | NMH â†‘ more | NML ~ same |
| 4Ã— PMOS | NMH â†‘ slightly | NML â†“ small |
| 5Ã— PMOS | NMH peaks | NML small drop |

Key takeaways:

- PMOS controls how strongly logic â€˜1â€™ is preserved.
- Larger PMOS improves **NMH**.
- Beyond a limit, further increase reduces **NML** (NMOS becomes weaker in comparison).

This variation demonstrates **CMOS inverter robustness** â€” even with fabrication variations, noise margins stay in safe ranges.

## âœ… Final Understanding

âœ” CMOS inverter noise robustness is determined using NMH & NML

âœ” These come from the DC transfer curve by locating threshold transitions

âœ” PMOS sizing directly affects noise margins

âœ” Lab results verified the theoretical expectations

âœ” Even with sizing variations, CMOS logic maintains safe operational stability

## ðŸ”¹ Lab Validation (Ngspice)

Using **Sky130 PDK** and `ngspice`, a DC sweep was done:

- Input (Vin): 0 â†’ 1.8V in steps of 0.01
- Plot: `Vout vs Vin`

By clicking on slopes where derivative â‰ˆ âˆ’1, we identified:

Example values:d

- VOH â‰ˆ 1.75 V
- VOL â‰ˆ 0.084 V
- VIL â‰ˆ 0.737 V
- VIH â‰ˆ 0.996 V

From this:

```
NMH = VOH âˆ’ VIH  â‰ˆ 1.75  âˆ’ 0.996 = 0.754 V
NML = VIL âˆ’ VOL  â‰ˆ 0.737 âˆ’ 0.084 = 0.653 V
```

These confirm:

- Wide tolerance for both low and high noise
- CMOS inverter remains immune to glitches in most ranges
